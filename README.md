<b>Important Email Marketing KPI's</b>

Formula to calculate these metrics:

: <b>Click Through Rate =</b> Total Emails Clicked / Total Emails Sent - Total Bounced 

: <b>Bounce Rate =</b> (Bounce Emails / Sent Emails) * 100 

Tip - Don't write " * 100", instead simply indicate it as percentage %

Number of emails read = Email_Open_Count

: <b>Delivery Rate =</b> (Delivered Emails / Total Sent) * 100
